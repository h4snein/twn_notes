# twn_notes

This repository will contain all the notes that I will be taking in the TWN courses. The intension behind is to get the credly badge as well as train work collegues as a deliverable for next year - 2024 

# General guideline

- The course progress will be documented section-based.
- The TWN course contains chapter 0 - 16
- Some of the chapters will not be documented if i feel like this can be easily delivered without any notes.

# Chapter 2 - Operating Systems & Linux Basics
